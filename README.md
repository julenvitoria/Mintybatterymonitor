# Script basado en el de HollyHoo modificado para el proyecto miguelito ;)

# Mintybatterymonitor!
This script is used in conjuction with Helder's battery monitoring board for the MintyPi.
This script will display a battery icon according to battery level and will show a warning video when reaching low level.  Upon critical battery level, the script will show a critical battery level warning video and then introduce a safe shutdown.  The battery monitoring can be toggled on or off by holding the select button for two seconds.

Also included in this script is an on demand shutdown button script.  If desired, a simple tact switch can be installed to GPIO 7.  The script will monitor that GPIO in the background and invoke a safe shutdown when pressed.
